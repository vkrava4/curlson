## Overview
`curlson` is a command-line project which is designed to perform thousands of concurrent requests with specified data based 
on user-templates or static values to destination address with handy statistic reports and tracing options.

It can be used for execution of single requests due to its similar syntax with `curl`, however, primary use-case lay in the field of 
concurrent and repetitive requests execution to one or several destinations. This makes `curlson` a perfect candidate for stress and chaos 
testing scenarios.

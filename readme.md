## Overview
Curlson is a command-line tool which designed to perform thousands of concurrent requests per second with specified data based 
on user-templates or static values to destination address with handy statistic reports and tracing options.

It can be used for execution of single requests due to its similar syntax with `curl`, however, its primary use-case lay in the field of 
frequent concurrent requests executions. This makes Curlson a perfect candidate for stress and chaos 
testing scenarios.
